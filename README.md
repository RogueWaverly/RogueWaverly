Hi, I'm Waverly Roeger

### About Me
Through code, community, and language, I am an artist and leader striving to bring order to chaos and make a positive impact on the world.

### Values
I value continually challenging myself, building communities, increasing diversity and cultural awareness especially in STEAM, and being a mentor and educator.

### Experience
My professional and academic experience includes backend design and development with Python, relational database design (with a strong interest in graph databases), and RESTful API development with demonstrated abilities in leadership, project management, and team collaboration.

### Interests
My interests include algorithms, graph theory, tech for social good, thoughtful design, improving education, creating mazes and algorithmic art, and sunsets.

### Seeking
Beginning mid-April, I will be actively seeking senior or lead backend development roles in the NYC area. I'm also always looking for volunteer opportunities with computer science education.

### Contact Me
Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wroeger/) with any opportunities to further my passions, requests for custom mazes, or conversations about interests we share.
